## Practice Questions

### Problem 1: Average of Three Numbers
**Task**: Enter 3 numbers from the user and create a function to print their average.

**Example**:
```java
double average(int a, int b, int c) {
    return (a + b + c) / 3.0;
}
```

### Problem 2: Sum of All Odd Numbers
**Task**: Write a function to print the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to `n`.

**Example**:
```java
int sumOfOddNumbers(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

### Problem 3: Greater of Two Numbers
**Task**: Write a function that takes in 2 numbers and returns the greater of those two.

**Example**:
```java
int greater(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}
```

### Problem 4: Circumference of a Circle
**Task**: Write a function that takes in the radius as input and returns the circumference of a circle.  
**Formula**: Circumference = 2 * Ï€ * radius

**Example**:
```java
double circumference(double radius) {
    return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
}
```

### Problem 5: Voting Eligibility
**Task**: Write a function that takes in age as input and returns if that person is eligible to vote or not. A person of age > 18 is eligible to vote.

**Example**:
```java
boolean isEligibleToVote(int age) {
    return age > 18;
}
```

### Problem 6: Infinite Loop
**Task**: Write an infinite loop using the `do-while` condition.

**Example**:
```java
do {
    System.out.println("This loop runs forever.");
} while (true);
```

### Problem 7: Count of Positive, Negative, and Zero Numbers
**Task**: Write a program to enter numbers till the user wants, and at the end, it should display the count of positive, negative, and zeros entered.

**Example**:
```java
void countNumbers() {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int positives = 0, negatives = 0, zeros = 0;
    char choice;

    do {
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = sc.nextInt();

        if (num > 0) positives++;
        else if (num < 0) negatives++;
        else zeros++;

        System.out.print("Do you want to enter another number? (y/n): ");
        choice = sc.next().charAt(0);
    } while (choice == 'y' || choice == 'Y');

    System.out.println("Positives: " + positives);
    System.out.println("Negatives: " + negatives);
    System.out.println("Zeros: " + zeros);
}
```

### Problem 8: Power of a Number
**Task**: Write a function to find the value of one number raised to the power of another, i.e., `x^n`.

**Example**:
```java
int power(int x, int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result *= x;
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Bonus Problems

### Bonus Problem 1: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
**Task**: Write a function that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 2 numbers.

**Example**:
```java
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
```

### Bonus Problem 2: Fibonacci Series
**Task**: Write a program to print the Fibonacci series of `n` terms where `n` is input by the user.

**Example**:
```java
void printFibonacci(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    System.out.print(a + " " + b);

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        int next = a + b;
        System.out.print(" " + next);
        a = b;
        b = next;
    }
}
```
